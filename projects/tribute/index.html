            <p class="hero-bio"> Noam Chomsky an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, social critic, and political activist. He worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1955 to 2017, and has since served as laureate professor
                at the University of Arizona. [Chomsky&#39;s] voice is heard in academia beyond linguistics and philosophy: from computer science to neuroscience, from anthropology to education, mathematics and literary criticism. If we include Chomsky&#39;s
                political activism then the boundaries become quite blurred, and it comes as no surprise that Chomsky is increasingly seen as enemy number one by those who inhabit that wide sphere of reactionary discourse and action. </p>

            <p class="hero-bio">
                Chomsky biographer Wolfgang B. Sperlich characterizes the linguist and activist as <span class="quote">&ldquo;one of the most notable contemporary champions of the people&rdquo;</span>, while journalist John Pilger described him as a
                <span
                    class="quote">&ldquo;genuine people&#39;s hero; an inspiration for struggles all over the world for that basic decency known as freedom. To a lot of people in the margins – activists and movements – he&#39;s unfailingly supportive.&rdquo;</span> Arundhati
                    Roy called him <span class="quote">&ldquo;one of the greatest, most radical public thinkers of our time&rdquo;</span>

            <p class="hero-bio">
                In June 2011, Chomsky was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize, which cited his unfailing courage, critical analysis of power and promotion of human rights. Also in 2011, Chomsky was inducted into IEEE Intelligent Systems&#39; AI&#39;s Hall of Fame for significant
                contributions to the field of AI and intelligent systems. Noam Chomsky presents various reading materials, interviews, as well as numerous other educational resources on his website found by clicking <a target="_blank"
